1. What is whitespace?  
*My answer*: keystroke which has no visible character including new line, space and tab.  
**Book's answer**: Whitespace is the space between characters made up of space, tab, and newline.  


2. What is a comment? What are the two ways of writing a comment?  
*My answer*: Words used to describe the code which are not compiled. Single line comment which starts with // and multi-line comment which starts with /* and ends with */.  
**Book's answer**: A comment is a section of code ignored by the compiler that can be used as a note for anyone reading the code. The two types of comments are // (which goes to the end of the line) and ``/*     */``. 


3. Our program began with `package main`. What would the files in the `fmt` package begin with?  
*My answer*: `package fmt`  
**Book's answer**:  Same as mine.

4. We used the `Println` function defined in the `fmt` package. If you wanted to use the `Exit` function from the `os` package, what would you need to do?  
*My answer*: add `import "os"`  
**Book's answer**: `import "os"` and invoke it with `.: os.Exit()`.  

5. Modify the program we wrote so that instead of printing `Hello, World` it prints `Hello, my name is` followed by your name.  
*My answer*: refer to [chapter01_exercises_05.go](chapter01_exercises_05.go)
