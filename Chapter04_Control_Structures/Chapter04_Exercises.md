1. What does the following program print?  
```go
i := 10
if i > 10 {
	fmt.Println("Big")rap
} else {
	fmt.Println("Small")
}
```

*My answer*: Small

**Book's answer**:   

2. Write a program that prints out all the numbers between 1 and 100 that are evenly divisible by 3 (i.e., 3, 6, 9, etc).
*My answer*: refer to [Chapter04_control.go](Chapter04_control.go)  
   

   
3. Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiple of five, print "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".  
   *My answer*: refer to [Chapter04_control.go](Chapter04_control.go)
